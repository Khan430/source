Tamayyez is an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) Software which will read the number plate's number and Letters and save them in a text format hence
making it easy to search desired number plates without manually reading from the car's pictures. Tamayyez runs on a unique Optical Recognition Engine which 
also manages to detect the car's color, it's make, manufacturer's name and model. this makes the search for a suspicious car even easier.
